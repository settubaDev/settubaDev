# Senior Software Engineer & Mathematics Student

*Building principled, tractable sustainable technology through geometric computational methods with accessibility & energy-efficient optimization at the core.*

---

**5+ years distributed systems & compiler engineering** and **2 years B.Sc. Physics Engineering** → transitioning to **Mathematics B.Sc. at TUM** for rigorous geometric numerical methods in cyber-physical systems with demanding requirements.

Proven experience in **Kotlin/JVM backend systems** and **formal verification** in modern open source compilers. My self-study and research focus on **heterogeneous hardware-software co-design** and **privacy-first distributed architectures** on Apple Silicon 🍏.
