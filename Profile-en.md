**Professional Profiles**: [This profile in German üá©üá™](README-de.md) | [ App Store Front] | [Academic Publications] | [Technical Blog] 

**Complementary Specialization**: [Kotlin/JVM & Distributed Systems Profile](https://github.com/i-walker) 

> **Note**: The Kotlin/JVM profile showcases my proven enterprise backend and
> distributed systems expertise, targeting fintech, compiler tooling and
> large-scale application development. Both profiles represent the same
> engineer with complementary skill sets for different market segments.

*Focused on sustainable technology solutions and conscious digitalization approaches.*

## üéØ Core Expertise & Technical Philosophy

**5+ years** developing mission-critical systems in **Kotlin/JVM backend and desktop applications**, 
with proven expertise in distributed systems.

Currently **deep-diving into Apple Silicon technologies** 
during my first years of focused study, 
while pursuing **remote part-time contracting opportunities (30h+/week)**
and advancing mathematical foundations at TUM 
with a **focus on geometric approaches toward Signal Processing & Information Theory**.

### üßÆ Research-Driven Specialization
**Actively exploring and applying** Apple Silicon ecosystem technologies 
(M-Series, A-Series, S-Series) with research focus on:
- **Memory-centric Computing** & Unified Memory Architecture principles
- **Hardware-Software Co-Design** through hands-on experimentation
- **Heterogeneous Computing** - studying across traditional paradigms
- **Energy-efficient optimization** strategies over raw performance metrics

**Research Philosophy**:
Moving beyond isolated CPU/GPU/NPU/Neural Engine partitions toward unified,
memory-aware system design through systematic study and practical application.

Bridging traditional abstraction layers by combining pure mathematics
with microarchitecture-aware hardware-software co-design, 
where algorithmic choices inform hardware customization and vice versa.

### ‚ö° Technical Philosophy

Driven by **thoughtful, sustainable technology solutions** ‚Äî 
embracing a holistic problem-solving approach that considers both software algorithms
and underlying hardware microarchitectures simultaneously.

Rather than treating hardware and software as separate domains,
algorithms are customized to leverage specific microarchitectural features 
while adapting hardware designs to optimize for the actual problems being solved.

This integrated methodology combines software engineering expertise with
hands-on electronics laboratory experience, enabling solutions 
that transcend traditional (Hardware/Software) interface boundaries.
